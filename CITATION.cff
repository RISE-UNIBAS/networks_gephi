  This GitHub repository provides an introductory course to
  network analysis and visualization using Gephi, primarily
  focusing on applications within the humanities. It
  includes course outlines, showcases of network analysis in
  various fields such as literature, history, and cultural
  studies, and hands-on tutorials with data and step-by-step
  instructions. The course covers basic network concepts,
  file formats, metrics, and tools, along with Gephi plugins
  and data for practical exercises. It also explores static
  and dynamic graph representations outside Gephi and offers
  a list of tutorials, manuals, and references for further
  learning
